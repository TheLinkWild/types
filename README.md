# Types

Types is a simple header for types in C and C++

Types implement different types:

- `byte` a 8 bit integer.

- `uint` an unsigned int.

  

- `u8` and `uint8`, an 8 bit unsigned integer, a byte.

- `u16` and `uint16`, a 16 bit unsigned integer.

- `u32` and `uint32`, a 32 bit unsigned integer.

- `u64` and `uint64`, a 64 bit unsigned integer.

  

- `int8`, a 8 bit signed integer, a byte.

- `int16`, a 16 bit signed integer.

- `int32`, a 32 bit signed integer.

- `int64`, a 64 bit signed integer.

------
Types also define a boolean type, for the C programming language.
